##Terminote


###What is it?
Terminote is a simple note program for the terminal written in C. You can pipe data to it, insert a note and search notes among other things. It also has an interactive mode for managing your notes. 


###How do I install it?
Just `git clone` this repo, `cd` to the `src` directory and type `make`. 


###What does it run on?
I've tested it on Ubuntu and OS X. If you have trouble getting it to run on another *nix platform file a issue and I'll see if I can fix it.


###How do I use it?
Run terminote with the `-h` flag for usage information.


###Why?
I wanted to learn about linked lists and C, so this is what I came up with.


###It doesn't work.
Please file an issue here on Github or email me at the address on my profile.


###Can you make it do X?
Maybe, file a feature request or email me and I'll give it a try.
